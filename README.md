## ðŸš€ Tech Stack

Wora is built using a modern and robust tech stack that ensures both performance and scalability. The key technologies used include:

### **Backend:**
- **Laravel**: A PHP framework that provides a solid foundation for building web applications. It offers powerful features such as routing, middleware, authentication, and more, making it perfect for powering the backend logic and API of Wora.
- **Google Cloud's Vertex AI**: For dynamic content generation using AI. Vertex AI integrates seamlessly into Wora, helping creators generate content tailored for specific platforms through the power of machine learning.
- **MariaDB**: A highly reliable and scalable relational database management system (RDBMS). MariaDB ensures that Wora handles all data-related tasks, such as saving user preferences, generating and storing content, and managing user accounts securely.

### **Frontend:**
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid development and customization of the UI. Tailwind makes it easy to build responsive, modern, and aesthetically pleasing user interfaces without writing custom CSS from scratch.
- **Daisy UI**: A component library built on top of Tailwind CSS that provides ready-to-use UI components. Daisy UI makes it even easier to build a polished and visually appealing frontend without needing to design every component from scratch.

### **Testing:**
- **Laravel Factories**: Wora uses Laravel's **Factories** to simulate database entries and generate fake data for testing. This allows us to perform rigorous tests on various parts of the application, ensuring data integrity, content generation, and other features work as expected.
- **PHPUnit**: PHPUnit is used for running automated unit tests on the backend code, ensuring that Laravelâ€™s routes, controllers, and models function properly.
- **Browser Testing**: In addition to backend tests, Wora leverages browser testing tools to ensure the frontend is responsive and user interactions work seamlessly across devices and screen sizes.
